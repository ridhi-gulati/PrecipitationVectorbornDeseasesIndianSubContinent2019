### Introduction

This project is a collective effort to visualize the vector borne diseases in Africa for the year 2019.

### Getting Started
The rainfall datasets are collected from TAMSAT, a satellite-based rainfall estimation for Africa. The health data is collected from HealthMap website.

Download Rainfall Datasets:
In the TAMSAT website, there is the option to download either individual files or a single compressed zip file containing all products for a given time step and year. To download individual files or zipped files (one for each year), you can use hidden links by replacing the relevant date fields and download the datset for the corresponding relevamt year.
The version 3.0 files adhere to the following naming convention: rfeYYYY_MM_[dd].v3.nc

To view the dataset download Panoply software. Panoply is a useful, cross-platform application for visualisation and simple manipulation of NetCDF data.
